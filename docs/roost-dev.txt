ROOST-DEV(1)                    User Commands                    ROOST-DEV(1)

NAME
    roost-dev - local development server manager

DESCRIPTION
    roost-dev manages local development servers with automatic port
    allocation, subdomain routing (*.test), and a web dashboard.

    Dashboard: http://roost-dev.test

CONFIGURATION
    Config files are stored in ~/.config/roost-dev/

    SIMPLE COMMAND (recommended)
        Create a file with just a command. roost-dev assigns a dynamic port
        via $PORT, avoiding conflicts with other apps.

        Example: ~/.config/roost-dev/myapp
            rails server -p $PORT

    FIXED PORT PROXY (not recommended)
        A file containing just a port number proxies to that port.
        Fixed ports can conflict; prefer commands with $PORT.

        Example: ~/.config/roost-dev/legacy
            3000

    STATIC SITE (symlink)
        Symlink to a directory containing index.html.

        Example:
            ln -s ~/projects/my-site ~/.config/roost-dev/mysite

    YAML CONFIG
        For more options, use YAML format (appname.yml).

        Example: ~/.config/roost-dev/myapp.yml
            description: My Rails App
            root: ~/projects/myapp
            cmd: rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1
            env:
              RAILS_ENV: development
              DATABASE_URL: postgres://localhost/myapp_dev

    MULTI-SERVICE YAML
        For apps with multiple services (e.g., web + assets).

        Example: ~/.config/roost-dev/myapp.yml
            description: My Full-Stack App
            root: ~/projects/myapp
            services:
              web:
                cmd: rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1
                default: true
              assets:
                cmd: npm run dev
                env:
                  PORT: $PORT

        URLs:
          - http://myapp.test        -> web service (default)
          - http://assets-myapp.test -> assets service

YAML OPTIONS
    Root-level options:
        description   Human-readable app description
        root          Working directory (supports ~)
        cmd           Command to run (for single-service apps)
        env           Environment variables (map)
        alias         Single alias for the app
        aliases       List of aliases for the app
        static        Set to true for static file serving

    Service-level options (under services:):
        cmd           Command to run
        env           Environment variables (map)
        default       If true, this service handles the base domain
        depends_on    List of services that must start first

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    roost-dev sets these variables for each process:

    PORT          The allocated port for this service. Your command should
                  listen on this port.

    FORCE_COLOR   Set to "1" to enable colored output in most tools.

    You can reference $PORT in env values:
        env:
          API_URL: http://localhost:$PORT/api

URLS AND ROUTING
    Apps are accessible at http://<appname>.test

    For multi-service apps:
        http://<appname>.test              -> default service
        http://<service>-<appname>.test    -> specific service

    Examples:
        http://blog.test                   -> blog app
        http://myapp.test                  -> myapp's default service
        http://api-myapp.test              -> myapp's api service

COMMANDS
    roost-dev serve           Start the server
    roost-dev list            List apps and status
    roost-dev start <name>    Start an app or service
    roost-dev stop <name>     Stop an app or service
    roost-dev restart <name>  Restart an app or service
    roost-dev logs [name]     View logs (server logs if no name specified)

    roost-dev setup           Interactive setup wizard
    roost-dev docs            Show this documentation

SERVICE NAME FORMATS
    For start/stop/restart, you can target individual services:

    myapp                 All services in the app
    myapp:worker          The 'worker' service (colon syntax)
    worker.myapp          The 'worker' service (dot syntax)
    worker                The service if name is unique across apps

VIEWING LOGS
    Server logs (request routing):
        roost-dev logs

    App logs:
        roost-dev logs myapp

    Follow logs in real-time:
        roost-dev logs -f myapp

    Show last N lines:
        roost-dev logs -n 50 myapp

    Logs are also visible in the dashboard at http://roost-dev.test

TROUBLESHOOTING
    "Address already in use"
        Another process is using the port. roost-dev allocates ports in the
        50000-60000 range. Check for orphaned processes:
            lsof -i :50000-60000 | grep LISTEN

    App won't start
        1. Check the app's logs: roost-dev logs <app>
        2. Verify the command works manually:
               cd /path/to/app && PORT=3000 <your-command>
        3. Ensure dependencies (node, ruby, etc.) are available

    "Connection refused" in browser
        1. Check if roost-dev is running: roost-dev status
        2. Check if port forwarding is set up: roost-dev ports install
        3. Verify DNS: ping myapp.test (should resolve to 127.0.0.1)

    HTTPS not working
        1. Run: roost-dev cert install
        2. Restart your browser completely (quit and reopen)
        3. Check certificate status: roost-dev cert status

    Changes to config not taking effect
        roost-dev watches config files and reloads automatically.
        If not working, restart the app: roost-dev restart <app>

    Environment not loading (rbenv, nvm, etc.)
        roost-dev runs commands in a login shell. Ensure your shell config
        (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc) sets up your environment correctly.

    Rails PID file conflicts
        roost-dev automatically removes stale tmp/pids/server.pid files
        before starting Rails apps.

FILES
    ~/.config/roost-dev/           App configuration directory
    ~/.config/roost-dev/config.json   Global settings (TLD, etc.)
    ~/.config/roost-dev/certs/     HTTPS certificates
    ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.roost-dev.plist   Background service
    ~/Library/Logs/roost-dev/      Service logs
