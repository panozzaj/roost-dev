# roost-dev

A local development proxy for all your projects.

## Key Features

- Works with any web server (Node, Ruby, Python, Elixir, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Dynamic port allocation - no more port conflicts
- On-demand startup - services start when you access them
- Single or multi-service projects
- Subdomain support - `admin.myapp.test` passes through to your app
- Wildcard domains - `*.myapp.test` works too
- Static file serving
- HTTPS support with locally-trusted certificates (automatic CA generation)
- Web dashboard
- CLI for managing apps and services

## Installation

Requires Go 1.21+.

```bash
go install github.com/panozzaj/roost-dev/cmd/roost-dev@latest
```

This installs the `roost-dev` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `~/go/bin`). Make sure this is in your PATH.

(I'm not super familiar with the Golang ecosystem, so if there's a better way to distribute this package or you run into issues, please open an issue or PR.)

## Quick Start

```bash
roost-dev setup
```

Then visit **http://roost-dev.test** to see the dashboard.

## Configuration

Place service config files in `~/.config/roost-dev/`. Unless specified otherwise, the filename (without extension) is the app name and domain.

### YAML config (recommended)

```yaml
# ~/.config/roost-dev/myproject.yml
root: ~/projects/myproject
cmd: bin/rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1
```

Your command receives the port via `$PORT` environment variable. roost-dev dynamically assigns ports, avoiding conflicts between apps.

Optional fields:

```yaml
name: myproject # defaults to filename without extension
description: My App # shown on dashboard
```

### Multi-service projects

For projects with multiple services:

```yaml
name: myproject
root: ~/projects/myproject
services:
    backend:
        cmd: bin/rails server -p $PORT
    frontend:
        cmd: npm start
        depends_on: [backend]
        env:
            API_URL: http://backend-myproject.test
```

Access at `http://frontend-myproject.test` and `http://backend-myproject.test`.

Services with `depends_on` will automatically start their dependencies first.

### Multiple ports

Some tools need multiple ports (e.g., Jekyll with livereload). Use shell arithmetic on `$PORT`:

```yaml
# ~/.config/roost-dev/blog.yml
name: blog
root: ~/projects/blog
cmd: bundle exec jekyll serve --port $PORT --host 127.0.0.1 --livereload-port $((PORT + 1)) --watch
```

Note: Port numbers must be under 65535, so keep offsets small when roost-dev assigns high ports (50000+).

We may add first-class multi-port feature later.

### Static files

For serving static files, use a symlink to the directory:

```bash
ln -s ~/projects/my-site ~/.config/roost-dev/mysite
# Serves files from ~/projects/my-site at http://mysite.test
```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
# ~/.config/roost-dev/mysite.yml
root: ~/projects/my-site
static: true
```

### Fixed port proxy

If you're already running a server on a fixed port:

```bash
echo "3000" > ~/.config/roost-dev/myapp
# Proxies http://myapp.test to localhost:3000
```

> **Note**: Fixed ports can conflict between apps. Prefer YAML with `$PORT` when possible.

## Subdomains

Subdomains are passed through to your app:

```
admin.myapp.test -> myapp (Host header: admin.myapp.test)
```

Your app reads the `Host` header to determine the subdomain.

## Using a Different TLD

The default TLD is `.test`. To use a different one (e.g., `.dev`):

```bash
sudo roost-dev install --tld dev
roost-dev serve --tld dev
# Visit http://myapp.dev
```

## CLI Commands

See `roost-dev --help` for a list of commands.

Run `roost-dev <command> --help` for command-specific options.

## HTTPS Support

roost-dev supports HTTPS with automatic certificate generation for any domain.

```bash
# Generate CA and trust it (one-time, prompts for password)
roost-dev cert install

# Restart roost-dev to enable HTTPS
roost-dev service uninstall && roost-dev service install

# Restart your browser to pick up the new CA
```

Now you can access your apps via HTTPS:

- **https://myapp.test** - Your app with HTTPS
- **https://roost-dev.test** - Dashboard with HTTPS
- **https://anyapp.test** - Any domain works automatically

Certificates are generated on-demand for each domain. Both HTTP and HTTPS work simultaneously.

To check certificate status:

```bash
roost-dev cert status
```

## Running as a Background Service (macOS)

To have roost-dev start automatically on login and stay running:

```bash
roost-dev service install
```

This creates a LaunchAgent that runs `roost-dev serve` automatically. The service will restart if it crashes.

To manage the service:

```bash
roost-dev service status      # Check if running
roost-dev service uninstall   # Stop and remove
```

Logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/roost-dev/`.

## Known Issues

> [!WARNING]
> This is a development tool only. Do not use in production.

### Docker Desktop

> [!CAUTION]
> Docker Desktop on macOS is not currently compatible with roost-dev's port forwarding.

Both Docker Desktop and roost-dev use macOS's `pf` (packet filter) for port redirection. When Docker starts or restarts, it clears roost-dev's pf rules, breaking access to `*.test` domains.

**Workaround:** After starting Docker Desktop, re-run:

```bash
roost-dev ports install
```

**Alternative:** Access apps directly via `localhost:9280` instead of `*.test` domains.

Pull requests to improve Docker compatibility are welcome.

## Status

**Version 0.9.0** - Pre-release

This tool is under active development. The setup and operation work on my Mac and meet my current needs across a variety of stacks. I plan to bump to version 1.0 once I get feedback that it works reliably on other machines and that setup is straightforward.

If you run into issues or have improvements, I'm open to PRs. For larger changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach. I prefer smaller incremental PRs over large ones.
